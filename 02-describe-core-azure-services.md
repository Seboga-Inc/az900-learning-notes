## Azure Architecture Components

### 🔹 Azure Regions
- Physical locations around the world
- Data centers grouped by geography
- Examples: West Europe, East US, North Europe

### 🔹 Availability Zones
- 1+ datacenters within a region
- Provide redundancy and fault isolation
- Used for high-availability apps

### 🔹 Resource Groups
- Logical containers for Azure resources
- Used for organizing and managing permissions, cost, and automation

### 🔹 Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Deployment and management service
- Uses **JSON templates** (ARM templates)
