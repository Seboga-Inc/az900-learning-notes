## 🔹 Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **High availability**: Redundancy across regions
- **Scalability**: Scale up/down based on demand: vertical or horizontal
- **Agility**: Quickly deploy and experiment
- **Fault tolerance**: Automatic failover systems
- **Disaster recovery**: Backup and restore options
- **Elasticity**: Auto-scale services
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model
- **Security**: Built-in security controls

## 🔹 Cloud Service Models

| Model | Description | Example Services |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| IaaS  | Infrastructure as a Service – provides VMs, networking, storage | Azure VMs, Virtual Network, Load Balancer |
| PaaS  | Platform as a Service – focus on apps, not infra | Azure App Services, Azure SQL |
| SaaS  | Software as a Service – fully managed apps | Microsoft 365, Outlook.com |

## 🔹 Types of Cloud Deployment

| Type    | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Public  | Services available to the public over the internet | Azure, AWS |
| Private | Dedicated cloud infrastructure for one org | On-premise Azure Stack |
| Hybrid  | Combines on-prem and cloud | Azure Arc, hybrid apps |

## 🔹 CapEx, OpEx and Consumption-based

| Type    | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| CapEx | Capital Expenditure | On-premises, purchage upfront | 
| OpEx  | Operateional Expenditure  | Cloud , purchace service based | 

Consumption-based: i pay for what i'm using, this moment is time 

## 📝 Notes to Self

- Practice quiz: cloud models and benefits
- Watch short video on scalability vs elasticity
