## üîπ Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **High availability**: Redundancy across regions
- **Scalability**: Scale up/down based on demand: vertical or horizontal
- **Agility**: Quickly deploy and experiment
- **Fault tolerance**: Automatic failover systems
- **Disaster recovery**: Backup and restore options
- **Elasticity**: Auto-scale services
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model
- **Security**: Built-in security controls

## üîπ CapEx, OpEx and Consumption-based

| Type    | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| CapEx | Capital Expenditure | On-premises, purchage upfront | 
| OpEx  | Operateional Expenditure  | Cloud , purchace service based | 

Consumption-based: i pay for what i'm using, this moment is time

## üîπ Cloud Service Categories 

The shared responsibility model:
The line of reponsibility shifts: think about the layers [top-bottom] data - application - runtime - OS - vM - compute - network - storage
On-premisese - IaaS - Paas - Saas

| Model | Description | Example Services |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| IaaS  | Infrastructure as a Service, most flexible ‚Äì provides VMs, compute networking, storage | Azure VMs, Virtual Network, Load Balancer |
| PaaS  | Platform as a Service, less reponsbility ‚Äì focus on apps & data, not infra | Azure App Services, Azure SQL, AzureKubernetes (AKS) |
| SaaS  | Software as a Service ‚Äì fully managed apps, delivers business value, no responsiblity | Microsoft 365, Outlook.com |

Serverless computing (PaaS): 
Event driven: pay for the work that is done (CPU service), i dont pay for it messages, schudele events
e.g. Azure Functions; LogicApps

Sevice type based on a use case:
Based on the repsoniblity of the layer

## üîπ Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing: 


| Type    | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Public  | Services available to the public over the internet | Azure, AWS |
| Private | Dedicated cloud infrastructure for one org | On-premise Azure Stack |
| Hybrid  | Combines on-prem and cloud | Azure Arc, hybrid apps |
